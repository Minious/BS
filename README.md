# Boilerplate Phaser

This project provides the basic setup for a Phaser development environment.

## Getting Started

This project uses [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) as its game engine.

The game can be launched in dev mode with hot reloading by using :

```
npm run dev
```

Or create a build in the dist folder with :

```
npm run build
```

You can then launch the game by simply running an Express Http server :

```
npm run start
```
